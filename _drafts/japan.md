# Overview

I've visited Japan only once, so this is far from a comprehensive guide. However, I thought it would be useful to share some of my tips for travelling in Japan. This mainly focuses on Tokyo, Kyoto and Osaka, as these are the places I visited. They are very easy to get between using the Shinkansen (bullet train).

# Tokyo

Main sights:

* Imperial Palace Gardens - free to enter and a nice place to walk around. Lots of cherry blossom trees blooming in spring.
* Tokyo Tower - an iconic landmark in Tokyo, with great views over the city.
* Odaiba - a futuristic man-made island with shopping, entertainment, and great views of the Rainbow Bridge. There's also a beach here and the iconic Fuji TV building.
* Akihabara - a district known for its electronics shops, anime, and manga culture.
* Shibuya - famous for the busy Shibuya Crossing and vibrant nightlife.
* Ghibli Museum - Museum of Studio Ghibli, a must see for fans of their films. When visiting you get to a view a short film that is only shown to visitors of the museum and is not publicly released. **You must book well in advanced to visit here.** I'd recommend taking the metro to Kichijoji station and then walking through Inokashira Park to get to the museum.
* Shinjuku Gyoen National Garden - A large and very pretty park right near Shinjuku station.

Lesser known sights:

* Roppongi Hills Mori Tower - A 54 story building with a [art gallery](https://art-view.roppongihills.com/en/info/index.html) and outdoor [viewing platform at the top](https://tcv.roppongihills.com/en/). Great views of the Tokyo Tower.

# Kyoto

* Fushimi Inari Shrine - famous for its thousands of red torii gates.
* Kinkaku-ji (Golden Pavilion) - a stunning gold-covered temple set in beautiful gardens.
* Arashiyama Bamboo Grove - a serene bamboo forest that's perfect for a peaceful walk
* Gion District - known for its traditional wooden machiya houses and geisha culture.

# Osaka

* Osaka Castle - a historic castle with a museum and panoramic views from the top.
* Dotonbori - a lively area known for its street food, neon lights, and canals.
* Universal Studios Japan - a popular theme park with attractions based on movies and TV shows.

# Overview

I've visited Japan only once, back in March/April 2019 during the cherry blossom season, so this is far from a comprehensive guide. However, I thought it would be useful to share some of my tips for travelling in Japan. This mainly focuses on Tokyo, Kyoto and Osaka, as these are the places myself and my wife Dani visited. They are very easy to get between using the Shinkansen (bullet train).

When we visited we spent 7 nights in [Tokyo](#tokyo), 4 nights in [Kyoto](#kyoto), 2 nights in [Osaka](#osaka), including a day trip to [Nara](#nara), and then 2 nights in Tokyo again before flying home. Keep in mind we we're also seeing 3 friends while in Tokyo, so opted spend a couple extra time there.

# Tokyo

## Main sights

* Imperial Palace Gardens - Large gardens and park in the centre of Tokyo. It's free to enter and a nice place to walk around. Lots of cherry blossom trees blooming in spring.
* Tokyo Tower - Arguably the most iconic landmark in Tokyo, with great views over the city.
* Odaiba - A futuristic man-made island with shopping, entertainment, and great views of the Rainbow Bridge. There's also a beach here, the iconic Fuji TV building and a Japan's own version of the statue of liberty.
* Akihabara - Japan's "Electric Town", a district known for its electronics shops and arcades. There are several cool multi-storey arcades here, such as [Bandai Namco Akihabara](https://maps.app.goo.gl/ojku8NoF12M4UPeb6) and [HEY (Hirose Entertainment Yard) Taito](https://maps.app.goo.gl/TAH4ygFPa6xLS5kD7). We checked out the massive branch of [Yodobashi Camera](https://maps.app.goo.gl/NqVkNEdwU6d4uvDy8) while where there, which must be one of the biggest electronics stores in the world.
* Shibuya - famous for the busy Shibuya Crossing and vibrant nightlife.
* Ghibli Museum - Museum of Studio Ghibli, a must see for fans of their films. When visiting you get to a view a short film that is only shown to visitors of the museum and is not publicly released. **You must book well in advanced to visit here.** I'd recommend taking the metro to Kichijoji station and then walking through Inokashira Park to get to the museum.
* Shinjuku Gyoen National Garden - A large and very pretty park right near Shinjuku station.
* Tokyo Skytree - The tallest structure in Japan and third tallest above ground structure in the world. We didn't visit this on our trip as, although it's much larger than the Tokyo Tower and the Roppongi Hills Mori Tower, it's not in central Tokyo and would have required a trip to an area of Tokyo we didn't plan on visiting on this trip.

## Other sights

* Roppongi Hills Mori Tower - A 54 story building with a [art gallery](https://art-view.roppongihills.com/en/info/index.html) and outdoor [viewing platform at the top](https://tcv.roppongihills.com/en/). Great views of the Tokyo Tower.
* [Snoopy Museum Tokyo](https://maps.app.goo.gl/W5xqnQdFy9PJ3Yhk8) - If you're into Peanuts, this museum if excellent. Dani is a big fan, so we had to visit. It's moved location since we were there but is still appears to be well liked.

## Nearby Tokyo

* Kamakura - A historic town with many temples and the famous Great Buddha statue. I've not travelled here before but I've heard lots of good things. It's about an hour from Tokyo by train.
* Yokohama - Right next to Tokyo, Yokohama is Japan's second largest city, known for its modern waterfront area and Chinatown. Also about an hour from Tokyo by train.

# Kyoto

Koyoto is Japan's old capital city. It has many historic buildings and shrines. After visiting, you'll probably have had enough of Japanese shrines!

* Fushimi Inari Shrine - On the side of a mountain and famous for its thousands of red torii gates. This was one of the highlights of the trip for me. I'd recommend getting here as early in the morning as you can for this, as once the crowds arrive it's a very different vibe.
* Kinkaku-ji (Golden Pavilion) - A stunning gold-covered temple set in beautiful gardens. Also a highlight for me, to the point where we have large print of a photo we took of on it on our wall.
* Arashiyama Bamboo Grove - A bamboo forest to the west of the city. It can get quite busy with tourists at popular times of year.
* Arashiyama Monkey Park Iwatayama - A mountainside wildlife park with a circular walk featuring wild macaques and great views back over the city. The opposite side of the Katsura river to the Arashiyama Bamboo Grove, these can be visited on the same day quite easily.
* Gion District - known for its traditional wooden machiya houses and geisha culture.
* Higashi Hongan-ji Temple - A temple right next to the main Kyoto train station. Although it's not one of the main tourist destinations in Kyoto, it's worth the walk from the train station as it's a lot less crowded than other places.

# Osaka

* Osaka Castle - a historic castle with a museum and panoramic views from the top.
* Dotonbori - a lively area known for its street food, neon lights, and canals.
* Universal Studios Japan - a popular theme park with attractions based on movies and TV shows.

# Nara

Nara is smaller city near both Osaka or Kyoto and can be visited as a day trip from either. It's 50 mins from Osaka on the Osaka Loop Line or as little as 34 mins on the Kintetsu Limited Express from Kyoto. It's known for having roaming tame wild deer within the city and the Nara Park which has a lot of temples, including one of the largest wooden structures in the world. This was one of our favourite places that we visited. The locals sell a special cracker which you can feed to the deer.

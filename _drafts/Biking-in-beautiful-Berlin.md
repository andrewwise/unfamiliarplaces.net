Berlin is a melting pot of history, culture and art. We cycled through the multifaceted city.

You have to plan carefully to get all the hotspots of Berlin in and still seek out some of its hidden gems. I spent one of my days cycling through as many of the main landmarks as I could on one of the Fat Tire Tours.

We met our tour guide at the base of the Fernsehturm, a TV Tower built in the 1960s by the German Democratic Republic – commonly known as East Germany – and which stands today as the second tallest structure in the EU. From the moment we collected our bikes for the Day City Tour until the last stretch of our leisurely cycle, we took in sights that harked back to Prussian history through to the present day.

Although Berlin was a city divided only 27 years ago, it’s impressive how much things have turned around since its wall fell.

The artistic nature of the city shows that the constraints of the former German Democratic Republic have been cast off and the skyscrapers of Potsdammer Platz on the old East and West divide are a testament to progress.

Yet, Berlin’s history is well documented in its architecture. While eight out of ten buildings in Berlin were destroyed in World War Two, some have been rebuilt. This includes the Konzerthaus and German and French churches in  
Gendarmenmarkt. There are also monuments for victims of the Nazi regime, the most poignant being the Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe only a short distance from the Brandenburg Gate.

Seeing Berlin’s landmarks by bike allowed us to get up close with them, take in the atmosphere of the places we visited and learn about where we were cycling. However, there were still many places to see after the tour ended.

As we had been lucky enough to get some spring sunshine for our tour – a rarity at home in the UK – taking in a little more of this was next on our agenda. After we had returned our bikes to the Fat Tire shop at the base of the Fernsehturm, we took a few minutes to walk over to Museum Island. You can guess what kind of buildings there. But we, like many other people with a free afternoon, just wanted to go lie in the green space in the middle. While laying in the sun, we took in the sights of the fountain, the Berliner Dom and the museums that surrounded.

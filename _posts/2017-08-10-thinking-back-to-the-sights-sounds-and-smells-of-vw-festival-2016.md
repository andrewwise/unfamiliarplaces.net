> “You know what the worst place to be sat in traffic is? The queue to leave a Volkswagen festival…” I said. Dani laughed.

The smell of 50-year-old air cooled Volkswagen’s, with just a hint of burning oil, wafted in through the window of our car. We made slow progress along the twisting single-lane road in the grounds of a stately home somewhere in semi-rural West Yorkshire. VW’s queued up as far as we could see in front of us, and behind us too.

This was the first time either of us had been to a car-centered festival, or indeed a car show of this scale. Earlier in the day we had been amongst a field (literally) of cars old and new adorning the VW badge.

Beetles and Transporters, Harlequins and Rats, I caught some of mine and Dani’s favourite cars on camera…

This guy bought a new engine for his custom Harlequin VW Passat the day before setting off to VW Festival, fitted it and then drove it all the way from Belgium!

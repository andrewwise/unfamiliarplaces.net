# Getting around

## Transfer from the airport

Copenhagen Airport (CPH) is well connected to the city center. The easiest way to get there is by train, which runs frequently and takes about 15 minutes.

The airport is also connect to line 2 of the metro system so depending on where you are travelling from the airport this might be a better choice for your.

## Public transport

Copenhagen has an extensive public transport system that includes buses, trains, and a metro train.

I would recommend downloading the [rejsekort app](https://www.rejsekort.dk/en/rejsekort_app) and configuring it with your card details. This allows you jump on any form of public transport in Denmark, use the app to "activate" your journey and then "deactivate" it at the end of your journey. This will then automatically charge you the correct amount for your journey without having to find and navigate a ticket machine. Only one person in any given group is required to have the app as they can add other passengers to their journey.

## Bike share

There are various different choice of bike share in Copenhagen. My preference is [Donkey Bike](https://www.donkey.bike/) (aka Donkey Republic). These bright orange bikes can be found all over the city and be unlocked with the Donkey Bike app. They also operate in other cities so once you have set up the app it can be useful on other travels. They're also mainly conventional bikes (as opposed to e-bikes) and are generally good value.

Be sure to check over the condition of the bike you are renting before unlocking it with app.
